            <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000ff"><u>Answer 2 </u><br>
              </font></b>Most of the videos are intentionally short so that clients on a 
              dial up connection can still view them. However, if you are on a 
              particularly slow dial up connection or your Internet service 
              provider is particularly slow you may need to wait a few minutes 
              for the video to play. Once the video has downloaded you can always play click again 
             and it will play all the way through without the stopping. <strong> See Question 5</strong></p>

            <p align="left"><b><font color="#0000ff"><u>Answer 3 </u><br>
              </font></b>No, The membership site was created so that you will always have 
              access to the videos. If we allow the videos to be downloaded 
              then it would only be a matter of time before the videos were 
              passed around. This way we keep the videos strictly for clients 
              who have paid.</p>
            <p align="left"><u><span class="style13">Question 4</span></u><br>
I am not sure if there is a problem with my PC or my connection. Do you
have to be connected to the internet when clicking on the links to read
the documents or watch the videos?</p>
            <p align="left"><u><span class="style15">Answer 4 </span></u><br>
  Yes, you do need to be connected to download the Money Management document or watch the videos.</p>
            <p align="left"><u><span class="style13">Question 5 </span></u><br>
Thanks for the activaction of my account. I only have a small problem 
and it is that<strong> I cannot view the first video</strong>. The video starts 
to play and after about 20 seconds it stops and won't go any 
further. Please help.</p>
            <p align="left"><u><span class="style15">Answer 5</span></u><br>
 I have tested the first video on a few computers and they all 
 seem to work and I have no other reports of a problem with that 
 video. That doesn't mean you don't have a problem, I am just 
 demonstrating that I think the problem is your side.</p>
            <p align="left">Here's what I think is happening. The first few videos are 
             larger in size than the others. Depending on the speed of your 
             connection the video may stop after the first few second until 
             it has downloaded more of the video. This gives the effect of 
             the video stopping and starting or just stopping. The best way 
             to overcome this is to just leave it for a few minutes until the 
             whole video has downloaded. Once the video has downloaded you can always play click again 
             and it will play all the way through without the stopping.<br>
             <br>
             If you can see the Play-Pause-Stop buttons or boarders then the 
           video is fine, it is just taking a long time to download.</p>
            <p align="left">The second reason is that there may be a lot of people viewing the 
             video at the same time. This might slow down the download speed. This 
             problem should ease after the initial launch.</p>
            <p align="left"><u><span class="style13">Question 6 </span></u><br>
I can't view the videos or some of the links. All I hear is a<strong> blip noise</strong> when I click on the links.</p>
            <p align="left"><u><span class="style15">Answer 6 </span></u><br>
 The videos and some of the links open in a new window. This 
 causes some computer to see the new window as a pop-up and 
 blocks it. If you are using Google tool bar just click the pop-
 up button to allow pop-ups. If you are using Internet Explorer 
 go to tools&gt;&gt;Internet Options and un check "Block pop-ups". 
 click. Nortons security can also cause this problem but it will 
 depend on the version you have as to how you allow pop-ups. If 
 you are using anything else just refer to their help manual to 
 find out how to allow pop-ups.</p>
            <p align="left"><u><strong>FeedBack</strong></u><br>
              I have an interesting story for you. I printed your last 
              Email, then printed the FAQ info. I searched Norton for 
              clues to no reward. I then went to the Traderssecret page 
              and, just for the hell of it, I clicked on the Intro icon 
              for Flash. It worked! The only thing I had done was to 
              turn my computer off after I sent you my "help" email and 
              restart it the next day. Without thinking, I had done the 
              ol' "turn off and re-boot" trick. That's all it took. It 
              might be a good idea to add that instruction to your 
              intro page for users of Windows XP Home Edition non-geek 
              owners like me. As of now, everything is fine and I'm 
              looking at videos. Thank you for staying in touch.              </p>

            <p align="left"><span class="style15"><u>Answer 1 </u></span><br>
In 99.9% of the cases where that error occurs, it is because either the
client has an old version of acrobat reader or does not have acrobat
reader. In either case you can up grade or install acrobat reader for
free at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html</a></p>

If you have an older version of Adobe Reader installed on your

attachment.</p>
            <p align="left">Please
upgrade your current version of Adobe Reader to version 6 by
downloading the newer version from the Adobe web site stated above.
Once you have installed Adobe Reader version 5, 6, or 7 then simply
double-click on the .pdf document.</p>

This normally happens when you Left click to download instead of RIGHT
clicking and selecting "Save Target As". When you left click, your
computer is trying to open the pdf file in your browser window and it
would eventually open but it might take a long time. Remember to Right

Today ordered your Traders Secret Code video program while 
trying to download the bonus e-book, Trading for Beginners, the 
following response keeps showing "This file is damaged and could 
not be repaired". Acrobat Reader 7.0 is loaded on my computer. 
How do we resolve? </p>
            <p align="left"><u><span class="style15">Answer 6 </span></u><br>
 Can you download and open the Money Management pdf? The reason I 
 am asking is because I have just checked that the download is 
 working properly and everything seems ok this side. If you can 
 download and open the Money Management pdf, then the problem may 
 be your side as both are the same version of acrobat. Just try  
 again, it may have been corrupted during the download. Just 
 delete the copy you have and start again. If you can open the  Money Management pdf, then it is highly likely the problem is a 
 corruption during the download, which could be caused if there 
 were an interruption on your line during the download. Have a 
 look at the other FAQ. Worst case, drop us a line and we will 
 send it via email. </p>

              the first link or the second link. The second link simply has  
              the .exe file in a folder as some computers have certain

            </span>Have been through all the set up videos and am not clear on the 
            channel settings.<br>
            1) Is the offset of 1 a percentage? For example the offset of 1 
            of the simple 2 period MA of the highs is 1% above the 2 period 
            MA of the highs.<br>
            2) I had expected that the offset of the 2 period MA of the 
            lows would be -1, i.e. in the opposite direction to the MA of 
            the highs otherwise it would appear that the system could be 
           biased towards short positions. Am I missing a point here?</p>
            <p align="left"><u><span class="style15">Answer 1 </span></u><br>
 1. No, Most charting software does do this now but it means 
 simply moving the average one place to the right, not a %. 
 Imagine you placed a pieces of tracing paper on top of your 
 chart and drew the average on that piece of paper. Then imagine 
 you simply move that average slightly over to the right. 
 Alternatively, imagine calculating a 2 period MA in an Excel 
 sheet, then moving that whole column up 1 for a displacement of 
 1.<br>
 2. There is no bias in either direction. I think if you 
 understand point one then that might help.</p>
            <p>Have a look at this PDF lesson <a href="http://www.traderssecretcode.com/members/course/disma.pdf">HERE</a> (Right Click And Save Target 
             As).</p>
            <p align="left"><span class="style16"><u><span class="style13">Question 2 </span></u><br>
             </span>You are saying that important thing is to wait for all trends 
             (long, medium, short) to be in the same direction. What do you 
             do when all three are already moving in the same direction? Do 
            you wait for the short-term chart to pullback to fib levels?</p>
            <p align="left">Can you clarify how to enter a trade? If you want to buy, are 
             you waiting for the 20 EMA of the close to move above the 21 EMA 
             of the open? Or are you waiting for the price to move above the 
             upper channel (displaced MA of the high) on the short term 
             chart?</p>
            <p align="left"><u><span class="style15">Answer 2 </span></u><br>
             Yes, the perfect situation is for all three trends (time 
             periods) 
             to be in buy or sell at the same time as determined by the 20/21 
             averages. Let's assume that the long term chart is in buy, if 
             you are just starting with the method I would suggest to wait 
             for the market to pull back to a fib level on the long term 
             chart. The 20/21 should still remain in buy even if there is a 
             close below the lower channel line. So we have this situation. 
             The long term trend pulls back to a fib level and then you start 
           to monitor the medium and short term trends.</p>
            <p align="left">Now, depending on what you are observing you may decided that 
             when the short tern trend starts to turn up e.g. the 20/21 are 
             in buy and the closes are above the lower channel line then that 
             might be enough to trigger the trade. If you are unsure you 
             might want to wait for the medium term trend to also move into 
             buy. In summary - for a long trade you need some kind of 
             retracement in the long term time period. Once that retracements 
             start to show signs of support, you start to look at the medium 
             and short term trend to give you an indication that the market 
           has indeed found support and is startling it way back up.</p>
            <p align="left">If the Long tern trend is in buy and the medium term trend is 
             also in buy you can simply wait for retracements in the short 
           term trend using fibs or the channel to enter a trade.</p>
