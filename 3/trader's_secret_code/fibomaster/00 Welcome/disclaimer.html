      </div>
        <p>Trading
any financial market involves risk. The contents of this website is
neither a solicitation nor an offer to Buy/Sell any financial market.
The contents of the website, newsletter and members area are for
general information and educational purposes only. By using this
website you agree to the terms laid out in this agreement.</p>
        <p>"Trading
carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all
investors. Before deciding to trade you should carefully consider your
investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The
possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your
initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you
cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated
with trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if
you have any doubts."</p>
        <p>No one was compensated for their
testimonial. However testimonials are not indicative of future
performance or success. Unique experiences and past performances do not
guarantee future <br> results! Testimonials herein are unsolicited and
are non-representative of all clients; certain accounts may have worse
performance than that indicated. Trading stocks, options, futures and
spot currencies involves substantial risk and there is always the
potential for loss. Your trading results may vary. Because the risk
factor is high in trading, only genuine "risk" funds should be used in
such trading. If you do not have the extra capital that you can afford
to lose, you should not trade in any market. No "safe" trading system
has ever been devised, and no one can guarantee profits or freedom from
loss." </p>
        <p>Although
every attempt has been made to assure accuracy, we do not give any
express or implied warranty as to its accuracy. We do not accept any
liability for error or omission. Examples are provided for illustrative
purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice or
strategy.</p>
        <p>No representation is being made that any
account or trader will or is likely to achieve profits or loses similar
to those discussed on this website. Past performance is not indicative
of future results.</p>

        <p>Old Tree Publishing (Pty)
Ltd, in association with Mark McRae, the website and its
representatives do not and can not give investment advice or invite
customers to engage in investments through this website.</p>
        <p>We
do our best to insure that the website is available 24 hours per day
but we cannot be held liable if for any reason the site is not
available.</p>
        <p>The information provided on this website is
not intended for distribution to, or use by any person or entity in any
jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be
contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any
registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.</p>
        <p>Hypothetical
performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are
mentioned below. No representation is being made that any account will
or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In
fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical
performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any
particular trading program.</p>
        <p>One of the limitations of
hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared
with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does
not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can
completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. </p>
        <p>For
example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular
trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points,
which can also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous
other factors related to the market in general or to the implementation
of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in
the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which
can adversely affect actual trading results.</p>
